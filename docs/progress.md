# Progress - Data Layer Restructuring and Dashboard Integration

## Chunk Overview

- **Description**: Restructure data layer to follow clean architecture principles and integrate with dashboard
- **Milestone**: Consistent data layer structure across entities and functional dashboard with real data

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Task 1**: Refactor data layer to follow clean architecture principles
  - Notes: Created consistent structure for FoodEntry and UserProfile entities
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement SQLite data sources for FoodEntry and UserProfile
- [x] **Task 3**: Update repository implementations to use new data sources
- [x] **Task 4**: Integrate real data with DashboardScreen
- [x] **Task 5**: Implement error handling in DashboardNotifier

### In-Progress Tasks

- [ ] **Task 6**: Implement remote data sources for FoodEntry and UserProfile
  - Status: In Progress
  - Assigned to: [Your Name]
  - Notes: Currently using mock implementations, need to integrate with actual API

### Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Task 7**: Implement data synchronization between local and remote data sources
- [ ] **Task 8**: Add unit tests for new data layer implementations
- [ ] **Task 9**: Optimize database queries for better performance

## Issues and Blockers

- **Issue 1**: Need to decide on the best approach for data synchronization
  - Action Items: Research offline-first strategies and real-time sync options
  - References: See `Approach.md` for potential sync strategies

## Notes

- **General Observations**: The new data layer structure is more consistent and maintainable
- **Adjustments**: May need to update some UI components to handle potential loading states
