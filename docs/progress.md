# Progress - Chunk 5: Food Capture Interface Development

## Chunk Overview

- **Description**: Implementing the food capture interface and integrating it with the nutrition analysis backend
- **Milestone**: Users can capture food entries via text input or image capture, review nutrition information, and save entries

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks

- [x] **Task 5.1: Design Food Capture UI**
  - Notes: Implemented AddFoodEntryScreen with camera interface and text input mode
- [x] **Task 5.2: Implement FoodCaptureBloc**
  - Notes: Defined states and events, implemented logic for handling user input and state transitions
- [x] **Task 5.3: Integrate Image Capture Functionality**
  - Notes: Implemented image capture and gallery selection using image_picker package
- [x] **Task 5.4: Integrate Text Input Functionality**
  - Notes: Implemented text input field for manual food entry
- [x] **Task 5.5: Implement Placeholder RemoteNutritionService**
  - Notes: Created NutritionService with API integration for food analysis

### In-Progress Tasks

- [ ] **Task 5.6: Integrate Bloc with UI**
  - Status: In Progress
  - Notes: Connecting FoodCaptureBloc to AddFoodEntryScreen, handling state changes and UI updates

### Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Task 5.7: Implement Error Handling**
- [ ] **Task 5.8: Add Confirmation Screen**
- [ ] **Task 5.9: Integrate with Dashboard**

## Issues and Blockers

- Secure storage for API key not yet implemented
- Need to improve error handling in NutritionService and FoodCaptureBloc

## Notes

- **AddFoodEntryScreen Update**: Implemented UI for both image capture and text input. Added functionality to select images from gallery and take photos with the camera.
- **FoodCaptureBloc Update**: Implemented basic state management for food capture process. Needs further refinement for error handling.
- **NutritionService Update**: Integrated with backend API for food analysis. Handles both image and text-based requests.
- **API Integration**: Currently using a placeholder in ApiConfig for the API key. Need to implement secure storage.
- **Data Model Updates**: Updated FoodEntry, NutritionInfo, and related models to accommodate full nutrition data from API responses.
- **Repository Updates**: Modified FoodEntryRepository and its implementation to work with the new data structures.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the integration of FoodCaptureBloc with AddFoodEntryScreen
2. Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the food capture process
3. Create a confirmation screen for users to review nutrition information before saving
4. Integrate the food capture flow with the dashboard for seamless user experience
5. Implement secure storage for the API key
