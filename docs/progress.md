# Project Progress

## Chunk 3: Dashboard Screen Development

### Task 3.1: Design Dashboard UI
- [x] Implement the basic DashboardScreen UI according to the design language
- [x] Include the greeting message with user's name
- [x] Add subtitle with daily calorie goal
- [ ] Implement nutrition meter
- [ ] Implement recent history list
- [x] Add "Add Meal" CTA button

### Task 3.2: Implement DashboardBloc
- [x] Define states (loading, data, error) using AsyncValue
- [x] Implement logic to load user data
- [ ] Implement logic to load and display nutrition data
- [ ] Implement logic to load and display recent meal history

### Task 3.3: Implement FoodEntryRepository Interface
- [ ] Create the FoodEntryRepository interface with method signatures
- [ ] Implement placeholder methods returning mock data

### Task 3.4: Integrate Bloc with UI
- [x] Connect the user data to the DashboardScreen
- [x] Ensure that the UI updates according to the loaded data
- [ ] Handle navigation to the food capture screen when Add Meal is tapped

### Task 3.5: Implement Onboarding Check
- [x] Update UserRepository to include a method for checking onboarding status
- [x] Implement concrete UserRepository with isOnboardingCompleted method
- [x] Modify DashboardScreen to check if onboarding is needed
- [x] Implement navigation to OnboardingScreen if onboarding is required

### Task 3.6: Update Main App Entry Point
- [x] Modify main.dart to set DashboardScreen as the initial route

### Task 3.7: Implement LocalUserDataSource (moved from Chunk 4)
- [x] Create LocalUserDataSource interface in the domain layer
- [x] Implement concrete LocalUserDataSourceImpl in the data layer
- [x] Update UserRepositoryImpl to use the abstract LocalUserDataSource
- [x] Update dependency injection to provide concrete implementation

### Task 3.8: Resolve Compiler Errors and Architecture Issues
- [x] Fix async provider issues in user_repository_impl.dart
- [x] Add toJson and fromJson methods to User entity
- [x] Update imports and provider usage in dashboard_screen.dart and onboarding_notifier.dart
- [x] Initialize SharedPreferences in main.dart
- [x] Resolve conflicts between LocalUserDataSource and LocalUserDataSourceImpl
- [x] Fix UserModel constructor and toJson method
- [x] Restructure code to adhere to clean architecture principles

### Task 3.9: Improve Onboarding Flow
- [x] Add "Get Started" button to welcome screen
- [x] Implement navigation between onboarding steps
- [x] Add "Finish" button to complete onboarding process
- [x] Ensure proper navigation to Dashboard after onboarding completion

## Next Steps
- Implement FoodEntryRepository
- Complete the nutrition meter and recent history UI components
- Handle navigation to the food capture screen

## Issues and Blockers
- None at the moment

## Notes
- Local storage implementation was moved from Chunk 4 to Chunk 3 to resolve dependencies
- Compiler errors have been addressed
- SharedPreferences initialization has been added to main.dart
- Restructured code to maintain clean architecture principles and allow for easy switching of implementations
- Onboarding flow has been improved with proper navigation and completion handling
