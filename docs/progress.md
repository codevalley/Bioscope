# Progress - Chunk 4: Data Layer Implementation

## Chunk Overview

- **Description**: Implement the data layer with local and remote data sources, and a repository to coordinate between them.
- **Milestone**: Functional data layer with local storage and mock remote operations.

## Tasks

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Implement `DataSource` interface
- [x] Create `SQLiteFoodEntryDataSource` for local storage
- [x] Implement `MockRemoteFoodEntryDataSource` for remote operations
- [x] Develop `FoodEntryRepositoryImpl` to coordinate data sources
- [x] Define `FoodEntry` entity with nullable properties
- [x] Set up Riverpod providers for dependency injection
- [x] Implement `DashboardNotifier` for state management

### In-Progress Tasks

- [ ] Finalize UI integration with data layer
- [ ] Implement error handling and edge cases

## Notes

- The basic data layer structure is in place, but we need to ensure proper error handling and edge case management.
- Consider implementing a synchronization mechanism between local and remote data sources in the future.
