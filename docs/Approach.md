# Approach Document

## I. Introduction

Our mission is to craft a beautifully designed and reliable core experience for the personal nutrition coach app, now with an added social dimension. We'll build upon this foundation by integrating user feedback and data-driven improvements over time. Central to this effort is a visually engaging, Instagram-like feed for food entries, supplemented by seamless food capture, intuitive onboarding, and thoughtful guidance through ephemeral prompts (floating thoughts).
