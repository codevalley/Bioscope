## Chunk 3: Dashboard Screen Development

### Overview
Implemented the main dashboard screen, including UI components and state management. Achieved a functional dashboard displaying user's nutrition data and allowing navigation to food entry.

### Key Accomplishments
- Designed and implemented Dashboard UI with greeting section, nutrition meter, recent history, and add meal button.
- Implemented DashboardNotifier for state management.
- Created FoodEntryRepository and integrated it with SQLite for data persistence.
- Implemented food entry functionality allowing users to add new meals.
- Aligned UI with specified design language and improved code quality.
- Refactored code to adhere to clean architecture principles.

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of following clean architecture principles for maintainability and flexibility.
- Value of consistent design language across the application.
- Necessity of proper error handling and data validation in user input scenarios.

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding more detailed nutritional information to food entries.
- Explore possibilities for data visualization of nutritional trends over time.
- Investigate potential for integrating with external nutritional databases or APIs.
