## Performance fix for app startup

- Implement a custom splash screen that's part of your Flutter app, not just the default icon. This will give users immediate visual feedback.
- Use skeleton screens or placeholder content on the dashboard while data is loading.
- Implement aggressive caching strategies. Store the last known state of the dashboard locally and load that immediately, then update it with fresh data from the network.
- Use computed properties or memoization for expensive calculations in your state management.
- Lazy load data that's not immediately visible (e.g., food entries beyond the first few).
- Optimize your Supabase queries to fetch only the data you need.
- Consider using Flutter's DevTools to profile your app and identify specific bottlenecks.
- For production builds, make sure you're using the --release flag, which will significantly improve performance compared to debug builds.
